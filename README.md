<h2 align=center>== Description ==</h2>

This plugins is intended for people that must develop a website using wordpress in Argentina or for it.  
The plugin retrieves the official dolar value for Argentina, with or without taxes 
*i.e Country taxes and witholding of earnings (Impuesto PAIS y retenci√≥n de ganancias).*.  
&emsp;This plugin does not store the history of the value, instead it retrieves the current value and stores it 
in the database in order to use it as an ARS - USD value translator.  
  
* These are the parameters of the shortcode.
	- `[get_exchange precio=123]`: Set an USD value and translate it to ARS.
	- `[get_exchange get_precio=true]`: If you do not set this parameter, you will not return the **precio** value.
	- `[get_exchange impuesto_pais=true]`: Apply the "Country tax" for the dollar, which is the 30% of surcharge *e.g $1 USD = $100 ARS. With "Impuesto PAIS" $1 USD = $130 ARS*
	- `[get_exchange retencion_ganancias=true]`: Apply the "Witholding of earnings", which is the 35% of surcharge *e.g $1 USD = $100 ARS. With "Retencion de ganancias" $1 USD = $135 ARS*
  
**Note: There is something called solidarity dollar, that is the 65% of surcharge (this means that Country tax, and witholding of earnings are appliead), this dollar is used when foreign people wants to buy something in dollars instead of Argentinian pesos.** 
  
* Some examples:
	- Get the current value of $1 USD in ARS: `[get_exchange]`
	- Get solidarity dollar: `[get_exchange impuesto_pais=true retencion_ganancias=true]`
	- Get $15 USD to ARS: `[get_exchange precio=15 get_precio=true]`
	- Get $15 solidarity dollars: `[get_exchange impuesto_pais=true retencion_ganancias=true precio=15 get_precio=true]`

#### = Is there an english version of this plugin? =
  
There is no english version of this plugin yet, that is a feature i am working on.
<br>
#### = What about english users? We do not understand spanish =
  
I must prioritize my native country, since is an Argentinian oriented plugin, it would make no-sense if i write this plugin on english, 
what about the people who do not know english?
